### Hi there 👋

🌍 Based between London and Barcelona

👩‍💻 Graduated from Le Wagon after deciding to change careers from education/retail

🔭 I’m currently working on an app that converts a specific time in a place in the world to another place with a different timezone (sort of a timeanddate clone) called Meet Me and an app that sets up play dates for dogs called Tail It (see Pinned below 👇)

🌱 I’m currently learning Java Spring Boot
